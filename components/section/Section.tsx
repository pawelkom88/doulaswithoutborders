                Doulas Without Borders is a UK wide network of volunteers offering accessible,
                grassroots services to women and childbearing people experiencing multiple
                disadvantage and financial hardship during pregnancy, birth and early parenthood.
                Our focus is on providing the emotional, physical and informational support which is
                crucial during pregnancy, birth and early mother/parenthood. â€‹ A calm, supported
                mother or parent who is able to bond with their baby moves society one step closer
                to a resilient, connected and well-adapted next generation.
