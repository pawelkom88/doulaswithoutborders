                      &quot; I had no one here, all my sisters and mother are still in Syria. I had
                      never been to hospital for birth and I was very scared. I did not know what I
                      was being asked. When the Doulaâ€™s came, they were like angels, they explained
                      to me, they listened to me, they always made me feel safe. Every day I thank
                      God for them. I could go to have my baby and not worry about my children or my
                      husband. &quot;
